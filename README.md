# Dream-olfaction-Rscript
This is a script for the DREAM Olfaction challenge SubChallenge 2.

Our sense of smell, olfaction, is the least understood sense of all and it is commonly overlooked compared to other senses. 
We rely on our sense of smell in our daily lives and it would impact our live greatly without it. 
The goal of this competition is better understand olfaction, more specific, to build a model that predict olfactory perception based on moleculesâ€™ physical and chemical properties.

Here I used R package Caret to buid a machine learning model that predicts the olfactory perception intensity.
